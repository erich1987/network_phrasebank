# Network_Phrasebank
A community-driven **learning project** for experimenting with Python networking, encryption, and open-source collaboration. This project is designed to help contributors **gain hands-on experience**, explore new skills, and build confidence in open-source contributions—all while having fun!

- **No Complex Setup Required**    
- **This project runs entirely on localhost (your own computer) within your home network. As long as you have a computer and internet, you can run the code without needing virtual machines, cloud services, or advanced configurations.**

## Why Network_Phrasebank?
This project is about **learning by doing**, not creating a polished product. It’s perfect for anyone who:

- **Wants to explore networking** with Python and build confidence in handling sockets.
- **Is curious about encryption** and how secure communication works.
- **Wants to practice open-source collaboration** in a supportive environment.

Whether you're a complete beginner or a seasoned coder, Network_Phrasebank provides tasks and challenges tailored to all skill levels.

## Features
Here are the features we’ll collaboratively build, improve, and experiment with:

- **Phrase Encryption**: Securely encrypt and decrypt phrases using Python.
- **Client-Server Communication**: Exchange encrypted phrases between a client and a server.
- **Multi-Client Support**: Allow multiple clients to connect and interact simultaneously.
- **Beginner-Friendly Design**: No VMs, advanced setups, or external dependencies—just your computer and Python.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Roadmap (Still In Work!) 
### Phase 1: Laying the Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Build a basic socket-based server that listens for client connections.
- Create a simple client that sends and retrieves messages.
- Implement basic encryption and decryption for phrases.
- Add support for storing phrases securely in a local database (e.g., SQLite).
### Phase 2: Expanding Features (Weeks 3-4)
- Enable multi-client connections using threading or async programming.
- Add user authentication (e.g., username-password pairs).
- Create helper scripts for easier setup and testing.
### Phase 3: Advanced Exploration (Weeks 5+)
- Experiment with TLS/SSL for encrypted client-server communication.
- Build optional user interfaces: a CLI tool or lightweight web interface.
- Open the floor for contributors to suggest features and improvements.

- A basic understanding of:
  - Python programming
  - Networking concepts (client-server)
  - Encryption (optional, but you’ll learn as you go)
### Setup Instructions
**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network_phrasebank.git    
cd network_phrasebank

**Install required libraries:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Start the server:**

python server.py

**Connect a client:**

python client.py

## What You’ll Learn
